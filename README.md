## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Figma

### What I learned

This challenge provided me the opportunity to start learning the basics of Figma. Prior to using Frontend Mentor, I attempted to use Figma to create some simple svg elements,
and designs that I was using for my journey through The Odin Project. However, after starting this challenge without the use of Figma, I decided to download the file to experience 
something that I might experience in a work setting. Using Figma helped out tremendously, yet even with all of the added information, I still felt a little lost finding necessary 
information. Deciphering some of the Figma tools I did manage to find the sizes I needed.

Alongside Figma, I also wanted to attempt to add accessibility to this QR component. After watching some videos from Kevin Powell, I have been introduced to the concept of WAI-Aria, 
and wanted to put something in my code to hopefully make it accessible. After finishing the QR component the first thought that came to mind was how to make the actual QR accessible. 
From one of Kevin's videos, a reference to a CSS class helped create a hidden link that I hope will work for accessibility.

The following HTML created a span with a class of `visually-hidden` that wraps around the same link generated by the QR code.

```html
<span class="visually-hidden">
<a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/" target="_blank">
Link to Frontend Mentor Site
</a>
</span>
```
The CSS below is the `visually-hidden` class that helps hide the content, yet still make it accessible for screen readers to inform the user about the link.

```css
/* SR only */
.visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```
